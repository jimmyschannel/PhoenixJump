#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: After the original Flappy Bird was removed from the app store in my country, I realized that no game should be lost to history. Every game should be available to the public, no matter where they are. As my final project for Harvard’s CS50x course, I’ve recreated the experience with my own spin, ensuring that the simple yet addictive gameplay lives on.

Phoenix Jump captures the essence of the original, featuring a minimalist art style, one-tap controls, and increasingly challenging obstacles. Players guide a small bird through narrow gaps in pipes or in this cases, stallimites. Trying to survive as long as possible while aiming for the highest score.

I've also introduced a few unique elements to make this version stand out, including:

    New Themes: Different background styles that change based on progress.
    Adaptive Difficulty: The game gradually becomes more challenging, keeping players engaged.
    
This project pushed my programming skills to new heights, and I’m excited to share it with others who miss the joy of Flappy Bird. Whether you played the original or are discovering this style of game for the first time, I hope Phoenix Jump delivers a fun and nostalgic experience!
